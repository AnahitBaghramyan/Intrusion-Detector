# Intrusion Detection Readme

## Description

This Python script serves as a basic Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using the Scapy library. It monitors network traffic for potential intrusions based on specific criteria and logs detected intrusions to a file. The script also provides the option to send alerts, such as emails, when a potential intrusion is detected.

## Features

- **Network Traffic Monitoring:** Utilizes Scapy to sniff and analyze network packets.
- **Intrusion Detection Criteria:** Monitors for packets with a specific destination port (1337 in the example).
- **Alert System:** Sends alerts when a potential intrusion is detected, based on a customizable alert threshold.
- **Logging:** Logs intrusion events to a file with timestamps.

## Configuration

- Adjust the `alert_threshold` in the `IntrusionDetector` class to set the desired alert threshold.
- Modify the `dport` value in the `packet_callback` method to match the targeted destination port for intrusion detection.
- Implement the `send_email` method to enable email alerts.

## Usage

1. Configure the script based on your network and alert preferences.
2. Run the script to start monitoring network traffic.
3. Detected intrusions will be logged to the specified log file, and alerts will be triggered based on the alert threshold.

## How to Run

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the command: `python intrusion_detector.py`
